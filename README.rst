Kerasy
======

I want to **deepen my understanding of deep learning** by imitating the sophisticated neural networks API, **Keras**.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ways to install Kerasy:


* **Install Kerasy from PyPI (recommended):**
  .. code-block::

       $ sudo pip install kerasy

* **Alternatively: install Kerasy from the GitHub source:**
  .. code-block::

       $ git clone https://github.com/keras-team/keras.git
       $ cd keras
       $ sudo python setup.py install

Why this name Kerasy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Kerasy means "Keras" + "-y".


* `Keras <#Keras>`_ is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python.
* "-y" is a native English suffix of adjectives meaning **"characterized by or inclined to"** the substance or action of the word or stem to which the suffix is attached. It often plays a role like **"ish"**\ , **"esque"**\ , or **"like"**.

Keras is my favorite library, so I wanted to imitate it and add more algorithms for in particular bioinformatics (which is my major.)

   Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of `TensorFlow <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow>`_\ , `CNTK <https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk>`_\ , or `Theano <https://github.com/Theano/Theano>`_. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. *Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.*
